## Foundational Rules

- The goal of this event is to share movies we love with each other, to watch movies we have yet to see, and to encourage people to watch movies they might not otherwise.
- Our current hosting time is **7pm EST on Fridays**, life events can conflict with this! Do not feel obligated to attend if you have a conflict, we will be here next week.
- Please have your preferred name in your server name, so everyone can get to know you!
- Movies will always be shown with subtitles if they are available.

## Decorum of Members

- Avoid relegating the movie night to a chore or second screen, we are here for each other!
- If a movie is not to your taste, it is fine to say so, but please be respectful and avoid repeating the same point throughout the night.
- Talking and chatting throughout the movie is encouraged, this is a social event foremost. However, if you get ignored or shushed it is probably because the movie is at a critical point, or the person you are speaking to has temporarily muted the chat to focus on the movie.
- If you have a movie you think is great but it did not win, it is ok and encouraged to suggest it again. Passion for a movie makes it quite likely that it will be selected at some point.
- Movies are not revealed until partially underway. This is to prevent attendee dropout, and associated insult to your friends who suggested the winning movie. 
  - If the movie is not to your taste, you do not have to actually be paying attention, but be aware the majority of attendees DID want to watch this. We suggest watching movies you dislike with an eye toward filmmaking and cinematography. 

## Eligibility

- Must be a video available in digital format. Be cautious of old releases or festival releases. 
- No restrictions on genre, language, year of release, country of origin, director, rating, runtime, or other attributes.
- A movie is a single continuous video, regardless of whether it was originally a theatrical release, a streaming release, or a physical release.
- Amateur films and fanworks that are released on services such as youtube, vimeo, etc. are eligible. [Kickassia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJuz70OHrxE) is a movie, [Emesis Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0ODG8bFme0) is a movie, etc.
- Compilations of shorts are not movies unless they tell a continuous story. (e.g. [Phantasm: Ravager](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3627704/) & [Parkour Civilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pFwQiwRbcg) are movies, but assorted Tiktok Compilations are not)
- Sporting events are probably not movies, but we could be convinced otherwise.

### TV Show Clause

- TV episodes over 45 minutes are eligible, but must be entirely self-contained, without any external content.
- Metaplots should not be critical to the episode's plot due to this clause.
  - For example, Columbo episodes are eligible, Arcane episodes are not.
- TV shows are subject to a 4 week cooldown period, to avoid long term lock-in on a shows entire run. 
  
## Movie Selection

The standard movie selection process is through a suggestion and voting phase. On occasion, a [special event](#special-events) will be held instead. Participation is encouraged, but never required.

### Suggestion Phase

- Suggestions are open to all members of the server who plan to attend the movie night. You are not required to retract a suggestion if you cannot attend, but prior to ballot generation it can be done if you are worried about missing it.
- Suggestions are typically opened 48 hours before the movie night. The runtime, release year, and pitch/synopsis are provided by the suggester.
  - Most people do not further research the movie, so the suggester is responsible for providing a compelling pitch.
  - The suggester is also responsible for ensuring the movie is available in digital format.
  - Trigger warnings are encouraged, but not required. After all, we may not have seen the movie we are suggesting.

### Voting Phase

- Voting is open to all members of the server who plan to attend the movie night.
- Emails are not tracked for privacy reasons.
  - If voting manipulation is detected, we will be force to reverse this policy.
- Voting is open for a limited time before the movie night, typically 12 hours, depending on the Cabal member's availability.
- Voting is done by ranking the movies in order of preference, with 1 being the most preferred.
- As of December 2024, the voting method has been changed from [Instant Runoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) to [Schulze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method).
- The results are kept secret until the movie night is underway. See [Decorum of Members](#decorum-of-members) for more information.
- Movies that are not available in digital formats or otherwise ineligible will be removed from the ballot and noted in the header of the ballot.

## Special Events

For fun and variety, we have a few types of special events. If you have an idea for one please suggest it to us!

### Themed Nights

- Many months we will have a theme mentioned in the initial suggestion and voting ballots.
- Theme participation is not mandatory, but is encouraged and a movie is more likely to be elected if it fits the theme.
- Themes may have some additional rules, such as a runtime limit, IMDb rating limit, alteration to the voting method, etc.

### Birthday Dictatorship

The Cinematographic power of the birthday dictator is near absolute. if you are a regular attendee, your birthday night is the closest Friday night to your birthday. This may differ in the event of conflicts or other special circumstances.

- The birthday dictator must notify the Chairperson of the selected movies ahead of time, or stream the movie themselves.
- Birthday dictator must provide trigger warnings for the movies they select.
- Provided it meets the standard eligibility criteria, any video may be shown.
- They may selected any amount of movies to a soft limit of 3.5 hours of runtime.
  - Longer total runtime is allowed, but the assembly must be notified ahead of time.
- A repeated movie is allowed, repeat showings are not.
  - For example, though we have already seen it, the Chairperson cannot show you the Strange Thing About the Johnsons 7 times.
  - However, they may show you the Strange Thing About the Johnsons, and its 6 sequels.
  
### Games of Chance and Skill

Games nights are ways to get some random chance into the selection process. These follow the general movie criteria, but cannot be repeats of prior showings unless the selector has not seen the movie. 

To date we have run:
- Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction (~40 minutes)
  - Watch an episode of Beyond Belief, and guess if each story is true or false.
  - Highest score wins and selects the movie for the night. Tied winners must agree on a movie.
- Settle it in Smash (~10 minutes)
  - Select a CPU controller character for a smash battle royale.
  - The first character to be eleminated, and the winning character's owner selects the movie for the night.
  - Ties are broken by in-game mechanics.
- 
### Abdication

Some nights no member of the Cabal is able to be present. In this case, the movie revolutionaries (you, the audience) can ad hoc select a movie, viewing, or other event for the night. Cabal will notify the audience ASAP in these situations.
